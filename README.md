# Gradio-OpenAI-Chatbot

This repository contains the implementation of a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 model and a Gradio interface for a user-friendly experience.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate how Gradio can be used to create a simple, yet powerful, graphical user interface for interacting with a machine learning model.

## Directory Structure

Here is a basic outline of the project's directory structure and the role of each file:

- `README.md`: This is the file you're reading now, which provides an overview of the project.

- `davinci.py`: This file contains the implementation of a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 model, specifically the "davinci" version of the model. The chatbot is designed to generate human-like text based on the input it receives.

- `gpt.py`: This file contains code related to the initialization and utilization of the GPT-4 model. It includes functions for preprocessing input, generating output, and postprocessing output.

- `gradioexamples.py`: This file showcases examples of how to use Gradio to create a user interface for interacting with the chatbot. It demonstrates various features of Gradio, such as the ability to create input fields, buttons, and display areas.

## How to Run

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system. This project requires Python 3.6 or later.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate into the project directory.
4. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, install the dependencies manually by running `pip install gradio openai`.
5. Run the Gradio examples by executing `python gradioexamples.py`.

Please note that the chatbot requires an API key from OpenAI, which you'll need to provide in the `davinci.py` file.
